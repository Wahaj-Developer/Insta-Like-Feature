### **Double-Click Heart Animation** ‚ù§Ô∏è  

This project is a simple yet visually appealing implementation of a **double-click heart animation** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user double-clicks on a designated container, a heart icon appears at the clicked location, scales up, and fades away, creating a smooth and delightful animation effect.  

---

### **Features**:
- **Double-Click Trigger**: The animation is activated on a double-click event.  
- **Dynamic Positioning**: The heart icon appears at the exact location of the double-click.  
- **Smooth Animation**: The heart scales up and fades out gracefully using CSS transitions and JavaScript timing functions.  

---

### **How It Works**:
1. The `dblclick` event listener is attached to the container.  
2. On double-click, the heart icon is positioned at the click coordinates using `transform: translate()`.  
3. The icon scales up and fades in, then fades out and scales down using `setTimeout` for timing control.

### **Technologies Used**:
- **HTML**: Structure of the container and heart icon.  
- **CSS**: Styling and animations for the heart icon.  
- **JavaScript**: Event handling and dynamic animation control.  


### **How to Use**:
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Double-click anywhere inside the container to see the heart animation in action!
